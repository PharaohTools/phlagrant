Installation
-----------------

The preferred way to install any of the Pharoah apps (including this) is through cleopatra. If you install cleopatra
on your machine (http://github.com/phpengine/cleopatra), then you can install phlagrant using the following:

sudo cleopatra phlagrant install --yes=true --guess=true

You can omit the --yes=true to pick your own installation directory. To install phlagrant cli on your machine
without cleopatra, do the following. You'll need to already have php5 and git installed.

git clone https://github.com/phpengine/phlagrant && sudo php phlagrant/install-silent

or...

git clone https://github.com/phpengine/phlagrant && sudo php phlagrant/install (If you want to choose the install dir)

... that's it, now the cleopatra command should be available at the command line for you.


About:
-----------------
Ever heard of Vagrant? Well Phlagrant provides a solution for Dev Environment management in PHP. Phlagrant is for making
Development environments (Setup, Install, Sharing, Reproduction) easily - create and configure reproducible and portable
development environments. Install Phlagrant in one line within minutes on Mac OS X, Windows, or Linux. Create a single
file for your project to describe the type of machine you want, the software that needs to be installed, and the way you
want to access the machine. Store this file with your project code. Run a single command — "phlagrant up" — and sit back
as Phlagrant puts together your complete development environment. Say goodbye to the "works on my machine" excuse as
Phlagrant creates identical development environments for everyone on your team.



Usage:
-----------------

So, there are a few simple commands...

First, you can just use

phlagrant

...This will give you a list of the available modules...


Then you can use

phlagrant *ModuleName* help

...This will display the help for that module, and tell you a list of available alias for the module command, and the
available actions too.
